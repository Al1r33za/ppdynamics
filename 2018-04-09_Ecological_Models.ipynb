    "We now turn our attention to a different kind of biological modeling: ecological models. These models often involve spatial territory, and a possibly large number of individual agents woondering the landscape. This makes it perfect for using our new Object-Oriented Programming skills.\n",

    "The model that we will develop today is designed to explore the *stability* of predator-prey ecosystems. Such a system is called *unstable* if it tends to result in extinction for one or more species involved.  In contrast, a system is *stable* if it tends to maintain itself over time, despite fluctuations in population sizes.\n",

    "There are two main experiments of exploration to this model.\n",

    "In the first experiment, wolves and sheep wander randomly around the landscape, while the wolves look for sheep to prey on. Each step costs the wolves energy, and they must eat sheep in order to replenish their energy - when they run out of energy they die. To allow the population to continue, each wolf or sheep has a fixed probability of reproducing at each time step. This variation produces interesting population dynamics, but is ultimately unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second experiment includes grass (green) in addition to wolves and sheep. The behavior of the wolves is identical to the first point, however this time the sheep must eat grass in order to maintain their energy - when they run out of energy they die. Once grass is eaten it will only regrow after a fixed amount of time. This version is more complex than the first, but it is generally stable.\n",
